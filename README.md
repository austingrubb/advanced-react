# Advanced React

We learned several patterns this day:

* PropTypes
* HOC's (Higher Order Components)
* Render props
* Compound Components

To keep it easy to understand, we mostly did one thing at a time. Therefore, App.js ends up with not at all the patterns. To review the patterns that we learned, you'll need to use your git log history to see code that we had. E.g. you can type `git log -p` in the terminal to see what we changed over time.
